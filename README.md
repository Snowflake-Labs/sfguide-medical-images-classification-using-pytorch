# Medical Images Classification using PyTorch in Snowflake

## Overview
In this guide, we will leverage the power of Snowflake to tap into unstructured health data of patients and effectively run analytics on top of this data which is very critical to build a holistic patient profile and ensure health outcomes through data-driven insights. We will leverage Snowpark Container Services for model training wherein we bring a PyTorch model to Snowflake, perform transfer learning, train the model, deploy it for inference and leverage Streamlit to visualize the inference.
